# Gurmukhi Voice Search & Transliteration Tools

A collection of tools for working with Gurmukhi (‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡®Æ‡©Å‡®ñ‡©Ä) text, currently featuring:

## üü¢ Available Now: Gurmukhi Transliterator
A web application that converts Gurmukhi text to ISO 15919 format in real-time.

## Demo

### Quick Start - Transliterator

#### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm

#### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gurmukhi-voice-search.git
cd gurmukhi-voice-search
```

2. Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The transliterator will be available at http://localhost:3000

See detailed setup instructions in:
- [Frontend README](frontend/README.md)
- [Backend README](backend/README.md)

## üöß Coming Soon: Voice Search
- Speech-to-text conversion using wav2vec2
- Semantic similarity matching
- Support for English and Punjabi voice input
- And more...

## Project Structure
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/          # React frontend for transliterator (AVAILABLE NOW)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/           # FastAPI backend for transliterator (AVAILABLE NOW)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voice_search/      # Voice search functionality (COMING SOON)
```

## Features

### Voice Search
- Speech-to-text conversion using wav2vec2
- Semantic similarity matching for search results
- Currently supports English voice input
- Planned support for Punjabi/Gurmukhi voice search

### Gurmukhi Phonetics
- Converts Gurmukhi (‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡®Æ‡©Å‡®ñ‡©Ä) text to ISO 15919 transliteration
- Handles complex cases:
  - Vowel sequences (‡®≠‡®æ‡®à -> bhƒÅƒ´)
  - Gemination (‡®™‡©±‡®ï‡®æ -> pakkƒÅ)
  - True diphthongs vs vowel sequences (‡®ï‡©å‡®∞ -> kaur vs ‡®∏‡®ø‡®â -> si'u)
  - More features coming soon...

## Usage

### Voice Search 
```python
from voice_search import process_audio

# Process an audio file
wav_file = "path/to/your/audio.wav"
result = process_audio(wav_file)
print(f"Search Results: {result}")
```

### Gurmukhi Phonetics
```python
from gurmukhi_phonetics import GurmukhiPhonetics

# Basic transliteration
text = "‡®∏‡®§‡®ø ‡®∏‡©ç‡®∞‡©Ä ‡®Ö‡®ï‡®æ‡®≤"
result = GurmukhiPhonetics.to_phonetic(text)
print(result)  # sati srƒ´ akƒÅl

# Complex cases
text_with_diphthongs = "‡®ï‡©å‡®∞ ‡®∏‡®ø‡®â"
result = GurmukhiPhonetics.to_phonetic(text_with_diphthongs)
print(result)  # kaur si'u
```

## Installation

Currently in development. To set up locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gurmukhi-voice-search.git
cd gurmukhi-voice-search

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! However, as this is a personal project with specific goals, please note:

### Before Contributing
1. **Start a Discussion**: Share your idea in the [Discussions](https://github.com/yourusername/gurmukhi-voice-search/discussions) tab first
2. **Wait for Feedback**: Get confirmation from the maintainer (me) before starting work
3. **Keep it Simple**: Break large changes into smaller, manageable pull requests

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Include a clear description of what your code does
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Update tests and documentation if needed
- Be ready to explain your implementation decisions

### What I'm Looking For
